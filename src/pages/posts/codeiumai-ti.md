The use of AI-generated simulations in conjunction allows the project team to make informed construction and design choices by using data-driven insights on possible outcomes and alternatives. 

Informatics engineering is a multidisciplinary field that combines principles of computer science, information technology, and engineering to design, develop, and manage information systems. This field focuses on the efficient and effective handling of data and information, often involving software development, system integration, and data analysis.

Software Engineering: Design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

Database Management: Design and management of databases to store and retrieve information efficiently.

Networking: Understanding and managing computer networks for communication and data exchange.

Data Analysis: Analyzing large sets of data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making.

Human-Computer Interaction: Designing user-friendly interfaces and improving the interaction between users and computer systems.

Cybersecurity: Protecting information systems from security threats and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

System Integration: Integrating various software and hardware components to create cohesive and efficient information systems.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Developing intelligent systems and algorithms to automate processes and solve complex problems.
