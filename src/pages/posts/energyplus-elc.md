The use of AI-generated simulations in conjunction allows the project team to make informed construction and design choices by using data-driven insights on possible outcomes and alternatives. 

Electrical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It encompasses a wide range of subfields, including power engineering, control systems, electronics, microelectronics, signal processing, telecommunications, and instrumentation.

Power Engineering: Deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power. This includes working with transformers, generators, motors, and power electronics.

Control Systems: Focuses on designing and implementing control systems for dynamic systems in various applications like robotics, automotive systems, and industrial automation.

Electronics: Involves designing and developing electronic circuits, devices, and systems. This includes microprocessors, semiconductors, and integrated circuits.

Telecommunications: Covers the transmission of information across channels like fiber optics, satellite communication, and wireless networks.

Signal Processing: Involves the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals. This is critical in areas like audio processing, image processing, and communications.

Instrumentation: Focuses on the design and configuration of devices that measure physical quantities like temperature, pressure, and flow.

### 1. AI Powered Software
<br>
-> EnergyPlus™ is a whole building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model both energy consumption—for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and plug and process loads—and water use in buildings. Some of the notable features and capabilities of EnergyPlus include:<br><br>

### 2. Integrated, simultaneous solution
<br>
-> Integrated, simultaneous solution of thermal zone conditions and HVAC system response that does not assume that the HVAC system can meet zone loads and can simulate un-conditioned and under-conditioned spaces.
 <br><br>

### 3. Heat balance-based solution
<br>
-> Heat balance-based solution of radiant and convective effects that produce surface temperatures thermal comfort and condensation calculations.
 <br><br>


### 4. Sub-hourly, user-definable time steps
<br>
-> or interaction between thermal zones and the environment; with automatically varied time steps for interactions between thermal zones and HVAC systems. These allow EnergyPlus to model systems with fast dynamics while also trading off simulation speed for precision.
<br><br>

### 5. Advanced fenestration models
<br>
-> including controllable window blinds, electrochromic glazings, and layer-by-layer heat balances that calculate solar energy absorbed by window panes.

### Manfaat Energy Plus
EnergyPlus is a console-based program that reads input and writes output to text files. It ships with a number of utilities including IDF-Editor for creating input files using a simple spreadsheet-like interface, EP-Launch for managing input and output files and performing batch simulations, and EP-Compare for graphically comparing the results of two or more simulations. Several comprehensive tools for EnergyPlus are also available. DOE does most of its work with EnergyPlus using the OpenStudio software development kit and suite of applications.
