The use of AI-generated simulations in conjunction allows the project team to make informed construction and design choices by using data-driven insights on possible outcomes and alternatives. 

Electrical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It encompasses a wide range of subfields, including power engineering, control systems, electronics, microelectronics, signal processing, telecommunications, and instrumentation.

Power Engineering: Deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power. This includes working with transformers, generators, motors, and power electronics.

Control Systems: Focuses on designing and implementing control systems for dynamic systems in various applications like robotics, automotive systems, and industrial automation.

Electronics: Involves designing and developing electronic circuits, devices, and systems. This includes microprocessors, semiconductors, and integrated circuits.

Telecommunications: Covers the transmission of information across channels like fiber optics, satellite communication, and wireless networks.

Signal Processing: Involves the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals. This is critical in areas like audio processing, image processing, and communications.

Instrumentation: Focuses on the design and configuration of devices that measure physical quantities like temperature, pressure, and flow.
